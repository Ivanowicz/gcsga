## Immediate TODO

-   Replace item lists with UL and LI elements and figure out how to get a static grid width going for easier sorting with SortableJS
-   No need to do the whole bar thing but it'll be easier once SortableJS is in place
-   make sure containers actually work properly
-   implement item sheets
-   get rid of redundant partials
-   fix UI for compendium browser
-   fix nested itmes in compendium browser
-   figure out nested items for world item list (hidden items?)
-   maybe hide nested items in world item list, make sure to delete these if the parent item gets deleted
-   change item and actor lists so they look like GCS too
